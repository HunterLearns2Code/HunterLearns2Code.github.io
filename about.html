        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to MultiTaski, your productivity companion. My goal is to help others become more productive in their day to day lifes! In todays world, it is so easy to get distracted with technology, so I thought it would be great idea to fight this enemy with technology! My website provides tools and resources to help organize your life. </p>
        
        <h3>Creator</h3>
        <p>My name is Hunter Driskell and I created this website for a school project. This is my first website creation, and I plan to continue improving my web development skills and learning more about development! My next step is obviously learning the ins and outs of html/css, but I would really like to focus on JavaScript as it allows you to do so much more with your website! I included some javascript in my website, but it is relatively poor and I plan to improve.</p>
